# Microphone sounds washed out

Right click on the volume icon located in the taskbar and do the following
- Click ``Sounds``
- Then go to the ``Recording Tab``
- Double click on ``Microphone``
- Go to ``Advanced`` tab
- Uncheck ``Enable audio enhancements`` and youâ€™re done! Enjoy your mic!

# Alternative Method

If the above method does not work
- **Uninstall** the ``Realtek audio driver`` from Device Manager and the ``Realtek Audio console`` from Apps
- **Restart**
- **Install** the Windows 11 Realtek Audio driver (even if you're on Windows 10)
- **Install** the Nahimic app from the Microsoft Store.
- **Restart**

This should solve the microphone bugging out issue
