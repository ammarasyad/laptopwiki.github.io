# How to get rid of the popping sound in speaker after an audio stops playing

- Open ``Regedit``
- Search for ``ConservationIdleTime``
- Replace values of ``ConservationIdleTime``, ``IdlePowerState``, ``PerformanceIdleTime`` with ``01 00 00 00 4``. repeat this for all, **use F3 to find next** If regedit complains that value cannot be changed, just continue to next
