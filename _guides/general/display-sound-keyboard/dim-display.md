# Why my display seems too dimm for a 500nits desplay?

One of the things I was disappointed with initially was the display. It seemed a bit dim compared to other 500 nit displays.

If you are unhappy with yours, check:
- **Power settings**: It can ‘bug’ if you go from battery saver to other performance modes, not allowing you to change brightness. This will require a reboot
- **X-Rite Color assistant**: See which mode suits you
- **Windows colour profiles**: Setting to ``TPL_1600_Default.ipm`` as default generally nets a brighter screen
