# Battery lifespan & health info

## Battery lifespan

### What reduces total battery capacity over time?

1. Heat (can't really be avoided)
2. Using rapid charge
3. Keeping it above 80% charge level for prolonged periods
4. Letting it drop bellow 30% charge level
5. Natural aging of the battery

### How to prolong the period before the capacity/health falls under 80%?

1. Use conservation mode. Keeps the battery between 55-60% charge level
2. Use rapid charge only when necessary, not all the time by default
3. Don't put your laptop on a stove or on your bed

### What are battery cycles?

Every battery has an estimated number of charging cycles, which it can go through before the capacity/health falls under 80%. One cycle is 100 times charging by 1%. In essence: One cycle equals charging from 0% to 100% or charging twice from 50% to 100%. The number of cycles is different for each battery and is greatly affected by other factors, such as described above. Generally, on average, with average usage, one can expect about 500 battery cycles before the capacity falls under 80%.

### Where can I check my battery cycles?

In Lenovo Vantage or Legion Toolkit under battery details

### "My charge falls down even when plugged"

Battery charging will start only when the charge level falls under preset threshold. For conservation mode, this is 55% charge level

### "My cycles go up even though I was plugged all the time"

Battery can not hold its charge indefinitely and will slowly lose charge. This can be further sped up on some models, such as those using RTX3080 and running at max performance. Battery will slowly lose charge, and then get charged again, which in turn slowly increases the number of cycles. This, however, happens very slowly over time and will likely have only a minimal impact on the lifespan of the battery.
