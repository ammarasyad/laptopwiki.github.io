# How to turn on the laptop when used in a Vertical Stand

```
Control Panel -> Power Options -> Choose what closing the lid does -> Set the sleep button and close lid to Sleep
```

```
Control Panel -> Power Options -> Change Plan Settings -> Sleep -> Hibernate after -> Set to NEVER for on Battery and Plugged in (skip this part if it doesn’t exist)
```

- Then when you’re done for the day engage sleep mode from the start menu instead of shutdown

- You can also create a desktop shortcut that will kick in Sleep mode


  ``rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0``


- When you want to wake your Legion, simply interact with a USB keyboard or mouse

- Sleep mode uses negligible power and is perfectly safe to use long term
